# Finale

Hopefully by now, you are familiar and comfortable with using the editor.

So, where to go from here?

To speed up rig creation and prototyping, check out [PSD Rigging](/psd.md) for
automatically importing and generating rigs from .psd files.

For more advanced rigging, check out
[Inverse Kinematics](../inverse-kinematics.md) for automated bending of multiple
bones. Also works with PSDs!

## Exporting

You can export your rig to be used elsewhere by clicking on `File > Save` or
with `Ctrl/Cmd + S`.

This will create an `.skf` file which can be used for anything that supports it.
If making a game, please see the
<a href="https://skelform.org#runtimes" target="_blank" >runtimes table</a> for
an overview of what game engines are ready to use SkelForm.

You may read through the [pygame tutorial](./inagame.md) for an overview of
using your animation in a real game environment.
