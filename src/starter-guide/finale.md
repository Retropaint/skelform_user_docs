Hopefully by now, you are familiar and comfortable with using the editor.

So, where to go from here?

If your art program of choice can export .psd files, check out the
[PSD Rigging](/psd.md) section for how you can structure your work to be
immediately usable as a SkelForm rig. This way you won't have to create it from
scratch.

## Exporting

You can export your rig to be used elsewhere by clicking on `File > Save` or
with `Ctrl/Cmd + S`.

This will create an `.skf` file which can be used for anything that supports it.
If making a game, please see the
<a href="https://skelform.org#runtimes" target="_blank" >runtimes table</a> for
an overview of what game engines are ready to use SkelForm.

You may read through the [pygame tutorial](./inagame.md) for an overview of
using your animation in a real game environment.
